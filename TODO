World
- map exists as a low res cylinder of high level features
  - draw functions for each feature?
  - regular grid? 1x1, 2x1, 3x2, 6x3(sm as drawn), 8x4, 9x5 each sector is 16x7
- landing pads
- drone home (small pad)
  - drone refuels on pad
- other station feature
 - consider features with height
* Object location array
- Drop zone array
- Ships coming and going 
 - Z movement?
Rendering
- multi sprite objects
- z sort station sectors - sort by X displacement
- 3d effect
  - shade curvature by poking scanline pixels
  - Fill tile arrays based on velocity?
* Camera: Lag behind drone up to some maximum (defined by drone velocity?)
- Squash sprites up the walls?
- Drone needs black mask to stand out from bg features
Mechanics
* Objects' world locations defined by X coord and angle
* Controls - import from LC and replace vy with avy
* Collision detection - screen pix or world location based?
  * World location based but figure out a way to determine the absolute proximity when the objects are divided by the 100 'degree' disconnect
- Map/scanner that shows POIs relative to current location, or directional arrows on main display?
* Do location checks on objects
- Only perform collision checks on moved objects
Locations
- Station interior (concave)
- Station exterior (convex)
Gameplay
- Timed levels, with a number of tasks per mission. Bonus depending on remaining time? 
- Repair tiles
- Collect objects from pads
- Bring objects to pads
- Clean up free floating junk
- Retrieve dropped cargo
- Floating humans
